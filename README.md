- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Umang currently studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) in Australia.
- I have an interest in Python, SQL, JavaScript, CSS and HTML, not only to thrive in the tech world but also to create something innovative for myself. 
                                                                                    -
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analysis and web development. Also, I am interested in LLM and Database systems, DSA, NLP and Computer vision. 
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open projects in Python at this time because I am currently learning other languages than Python.
